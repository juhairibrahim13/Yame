  'TDI': 'The Playette uses her mysterious exterior as a shield against vulnerability. Her "iceberg" persona is a defense mechanism to test a man\'s persistence and emotional intelligence. She secretly fears being understood too quickly, as it removes her power. By remaining aloof, she forces men to project their own fantasies onto her, allowing her to maintain control without revealing her true self.',
  'TJI': 'The Social Butterfly uses constant motion and attention as a distraction from deeper emotional intimacy. Her need to be the center of attention stems from a fear of being ordinary or forgotten. She chases the unattainable because the chase itself is safer than the reality of a committed relationship. Her Justifier nature allows her to rationalize impulsive behavior as "living in the moment," avoiding accountability.',
  'NDI': 'The Hopeful Romantic is addicted to the narrative of love rather than the reality of a partner. She projects her idealized fantasies onto flawed men, ignoring red flags to keep the fairy tale alive. Her Denier trait makes her use sex as a bargaining chip for emotional commitment, while her Investor nature makes her cling tightly once she feels she has secured the "happily ever after," often suffocating the relationship.',
  'NJI': 'The Cinderella uses her sexuality and charm to secure a savior. She views herself as the protagonist of a romantic drama, needing a strong man to rescue her from her circumstances. Her Justifier trait allows her to easily rationalize infidelity or monkey-branching if a "better prince" comes along. She trades her devotion for security and status, often masking her transactional nature with intense romanticism.',
  'TDR': 'The Private Dancer uses her independence and logical nature as a fortress. She views relationships as potential liabilities to her goals and autonomy. Her Tester and Denier traits combine to create an extremely high barrier to entry; she demands a man prove his worth continuously. She secretly fears that relying on a man will lead to disappointment, so she maintains a calculated distance to protect her vulnerability.',
  'TJR': 'The Seductress weaponizes her sexuality and charm to gain power and resources. She is highly transactional and views men as stepping stones or tools for her own advancement. Her Justifier nature allows her to use her body without emotional attachment, while her Realist mindset keeps her focused on tangible benefits. She is the ultimate pragmatist, expertly manipulating male desire to serve her own ends.',
  'NDR': 'The Connoisseur uses her high standards and refined tastes as a way to filter out the unworthy. She views relationships as investments and expects a high return. Her Denier trait means she requires significant proof of a man\'s value (status, wealth, intellect) before committing. She secretly fears settling for less than she deserves, leading to a constant evaluation of her partner\'s performance and potential.',
  'NJR': 'The Modern Woman uses her competence and sexual liberation to dominate her environment. She views traditional relationship roles as restrictive and prefers to dictate the terms of engagement. Her Justifier trait allows her to pursue pleasure without guilt, while her Investor nature means she will commit to a man who enhances her life without threatening her independence. She secretly fears losing her edge or being controlled.'
